# About me

<img src="/assets/img/pfp.jpg" width=250, height=250/>

Hi there! To start off, I graduated in May 2021 with a BSc in Mathematics from UBC Vancouver, now pursuing a career in data analytics/data science. Follow me as I improve on my data and programming skills! Besides data and math, I am also a hip-hop dancer! I just started picking up more styles as well, such as, house, popping, and litefeet. House is my obsession right now. Maybe I'll start posting my progress videos here too :) Work and dance take up most of my time, but when I'm not doing either, I like to play chess (badly) and I'm currently binging Castlevania with my boyfriend.

Anyways, I created this site to create a one-stop spot where one can get to know me a little bit better and also check out the fun side projects I worked on.
