# About me

Hi there! To start off, I graduated in May 2021 from UBC Vancouver with a BSc in Mathematics. Currently pursuing a career in data analytics/data science. Follow me as I improve on my data and programming skills! Besides data and math, I am also a hip-hop dancer! Just started picking up more styles too such as house, popping, and litefeet. House is my focus right now! Maybe I'll start posting my progress videos here too :) Work and dance take up most of my time, but when I'm not doing either, I like to play chess (badly) and am currently binging Castlevania with my boyfriend. I love vampires.

Anyways, I created this site to create a one-stop spot where one can get to know me a little bit better and also check out the fun side projects I worked on. Enjoy!
